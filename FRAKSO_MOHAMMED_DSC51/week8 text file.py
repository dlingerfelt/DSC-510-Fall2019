Desc: This program will  work with a text file to perform the following actions:
Open the file and process each line.
Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
Nicely print the output, in this case from high to low frequency using string formatting.
Achieve each major goal with a function (one function, one action), so the program will have 4 functions.
