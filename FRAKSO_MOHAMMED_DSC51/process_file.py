Desc: This program will  work with a text file to perform the following actions:
Open the file and process each line.
Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
new function called process_file which prints to the file (this method should almost be the
same as the pretty_print function from last week. Keep in mind that we have print statements in main as well.
The program must modify the print statements from main as well.
