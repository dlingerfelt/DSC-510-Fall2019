# Assignment :
#     Create a header for your program just as you have in the past.
#     Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.
#     Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
#     Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
#     Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing.
#     Use functions including a main function.
#     Allow the user to run the program multiple times to allow them to look up weather conditions for multiple locations.
#     Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isnâ€™t presented notify the user.
#     Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
#         Use Try blocks to ensure that your request was successful. If the connection was not successful display a message to the user.
#     Use Python 3
#     Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful
