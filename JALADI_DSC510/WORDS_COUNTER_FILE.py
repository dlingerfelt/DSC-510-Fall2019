# Assignment :
#           Using comments, create a header at the top of the program indicating the purpose of the program, assignment number, and your name. Use the SIUE Style Guide as a reference.
#           We will create a program which performs three essential operations. It will process this .txt file: Gettysburg.txt. (Click the link to download the text file).  Calculate the total words, and output the number of occurrences of each word in the file.
#           Open the file and process each line.
#           Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
#           Nicely print the output, in this case from high to low frequency. You should use string formatting for this. (See discussion 8.3).
#           add_word: Add each word to the dictionary. Parameters are the word and a dictionary. No return value.
#           Process_line: There is some work to be done to process the line: strip off various characters, split out the words, and so on. Parameters are a line and the dictionary. It calls the function add word with each processed word. No return value.
#           Pretty_print: Because formatted printing can be messy and often particular to each situation (meaning that we might need to modify it later), we separated out the printing function. The parameter is a dictionary. No return value.
#           main: We will use a main function as the main program. As usual, it will open the file and call process_line on each line. When finished, it will call pretty_print to print the dictionary.
# Desc :    Program to calculate the words count in a file and print the words count order by most first
