# Desc: We’ve already looked at several examples of API integration from a Python perspective and
# this week we’re going to write a program that uses an open API to obtain data for the end user.
#
# Create a program which uses the Request library to make a GET request of the following API: Chuck Norris Jokes.
# The program will receive a JSON response which includes various pieces of data.
# You should parse the JSON data to obtain the “value” key.
# The data associated with the value key should be displayed for the user (i.e., the joke).
# Your program should allow the user to request a Chuck Norris joke as many times as they would like.
# You should make sure that your program does error checking at this point.
# If you ask the user to enter “Y” and they enter y, is that ok? Does it fail?
# If it fails, display a message for the user. There are other ways to handle this.
# Think about included string functions you might be able to call.
# Your program must include a header as in previous weeks.
# Your program must include a welcome message for the user.
# Your program must generate “pretty” output.
# Simply dumping a bunch of data to the screen with no context doesn’t represent “pretty.”

# Usage:
