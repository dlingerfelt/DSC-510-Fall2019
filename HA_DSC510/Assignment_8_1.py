# Desc: We will create a program which performs three essential operations.
# It will process this .txt file: Gettysburg.txt. (Click the link to download the text file).
# Calculate the total words, and output the number of occurrences of each word in the file.
#
# Open the file and process each line.
# Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
# Nicely print the output, in this case from high to low frequency.
# You should use string formatting for this. (See discussion 8.3).
# We want to achieve each major goal with a function (one function, one action).
# We can find four functions that need to be created.
#
# add_word: Add each word to the dictionary. Parameters are the word and a dictionary. No return value.
#
# Process_line: There is some work to be done to process the line:
# strip off various characters, split out the words, and so on.
# Parameters are a line and the dictionary.
# It calls the function add word with each processed word. No return value.
#
# Pretty_print: Because formatted printing can be messy and often particular to each situation
# (meaning that we might need to modify it later),
# we separated out the printing function.
# The parameter is a dictionary. No return value.
#
# main: We will use a main function as the main program.
# As usual, it will open the file and call process_line on each line.
# When finished, it will call pretty_print to print the dictionary.
#
# In the main function, you will need to open the file.
# We will cover more regarding opening of files next week, but
# I wanted to provide you with the block of code you will utilize to open the file, see below.

# Usage: Call main function which will call Process_line function and Pretty_print.
