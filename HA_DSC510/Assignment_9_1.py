# Desc: Last week we got a taste of working with files.
# This week weâ€™ll really dive into files by opening and closing files properly.
#
# For this week we will modify our Gettysburg processing program from week 8
# in order to generate a text file from the output rather than printing to the screen.
# Your program should have a new function called process_file which prints to the file
# (this method should almost be the same as the pretty_print function from last week.)
# Keep in mind that we have print statements in main as well.
# Your program must modify the print statements from main as well.
#
# Your program must have a header. Use the programming style guide for guidance.
# Create a new function called process_fie.
# This function will perform the same operations as pretty_print from week 8
# however it will print to a file instead of to the screen.
# Modify your main method to print the length of the dictionary to the file as opposed to the screen.
# This will require that you open the file twice. Once in main and once in process_file.
# Prompt the user for the filename they wish to use to generate the report.
# Use the filename specified by the user to write the file.
# This will require you to pass the file as an additional parameter to your new process_file function.
