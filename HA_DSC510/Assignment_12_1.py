# Desc:
# For your class project we will be creating an application to interacts with a webservice in order to obtain data.
# Your program will use all of the information you’ve learned in the class in order to create a useful application.
# Your program must prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
# Your program must display the weather information in a READABLE format to the user.

# Requirements:
# Create a header for your program just as you have in the past.
# Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.
# Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
# Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
# Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing.
# Use functions including a main function.
# Allow the user to run the program multiple times to allow them to look up weather conditions for multiple locations.
# Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isn’t presented notify the user.
# Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
# Use Try blocks to ensure that your request was successful.
# If the connection was not successful display a message to the user.
# Use Python 3
# Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice.
# You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful
