    "# File Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling is very important because data is typically stored in files. They can be csv, txt, excel or other formats depending on where they are retrieved from. For example, if users pull data from the database, it will be likely in csv format, and if data is retrieved from API on the web, then the format is likely to be JSON or HTML. Articles from the web would be likely to be txt format. As a data scientist, we should be able to handle all data format using programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "When opening a file from Python, we can ust open() function. The function takes two parameters: file name and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ r (Read): it opens a file for reading only  \n",
    "+ a (Append): it opens a file for appending and creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "+ w (Write): it opens a file for writing and creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also specify if we want to handle the file as binary or text. Text mode is a default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ t (Text): Text mode\n",
    "+ b (Binary): Binary mode\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a combination of modes as shown below:\n",
    "+ rb: Read only and binary\n",
    "+ wb: Write and binary\n",
    "Since t is a default, we don't need to specify."
